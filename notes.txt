By using Flexbox and media queries, this layout ensures that the webpage is responsive and works well across different devices and screen sizes.
Key Points:
Flexbox Layout:

The main content area uses Flexbox (display: flex), allowing it to adapt its layout by adjusting the widths of its child elements based on available space.

.content, .sidebar, and .main-content are flex items that automatically adjust to the width of the viewport.

Navigation Bar:

The navbar is centered using flex with a horizontal list of links, which adjusts to vertical for smaller screens.

Media Queries:

Max-width 768px: The layout changes for tablet-sized screens (e.g., the sidebar becomes full width).

Max-width 480px: For mobile devices, further adjustments are made like the navbar items stacking vertically and reducing font sizes for better readability.

Testing Across Devices:
Test the layout across different screen sizes by resizing your browser or using the device simulator in developer tools. This ensures the page looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
